  <b>“Decentralized Lending Protocols”</b> is a hot new sector in the DeFi space, though it’s nothing like taking out an unsecured loan in the conventional finance world.

  DeFi <b>“borrowers”</b> don’t sign piles of paperwork to ensure repayment—they instead put up crypto collateral via smart contracts on the blockchain.

  This allows them to free-up cash for day-to-day expenses or trading, without selling the crypto they believe will appreciate in value. If they allow the collateral to become insufficient as a result of market movement, the lending protocols liquidate the collateral instantly.  This area of DeFi is soaring in popularity.
